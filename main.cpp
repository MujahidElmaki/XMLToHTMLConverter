#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // High level thought process

    // Inside the XML are <CD> tags
    // I would need to loop through each tag and process the attributes inside them
    // This could probably be done using a dictionary

    // Questions I have for now.
    // Is there a global correspondence from XML to HTML?
    // Or can I decide how I want to frame my HTML file
    // How can I create dictionaries, loops, possibly memory management in C++?
    // Which frameworks or libraries will I need for the console?

    // Pseudo Code implementation

    // 1. Init a blank HTML page that will have html, head and body tags
    // 2. If the XML given is empty simply return the blank HTML
    // 3. If not then proceed by parsing through the CD tags, grabbing the attributes inside them
    // 4. Think of a way to map those corresponding values to HTML
    // 5. Add the values to the initialized HTML page
    // 6. Think about the user experience when the MVP is complete
}
